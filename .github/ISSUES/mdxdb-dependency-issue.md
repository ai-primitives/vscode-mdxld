# @mdxdb Package Dependency Issue

## Description
Attempted to install @mdxdb packages but encountered workspace dependency issues.

## Error Message
```
ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND  In : "@mdxdb/types@workspace:*" is in the dependencies but no package named "@mdxdb/types" is present in the workspace
```

## Impact
- Unable to directly use @mdxdb packages
- Created mock implementations as temporary solution
- Using type definitions based on @mdxdb interfaces

## Workaround
Created mock types in `src/providers/types/mdxdb.ts` to continue development while package issues are resolved.

## Next Steps
1. Report issue to @mdxdb package maintainers
2. Monitor package updates for resolution
3. Replace mock implementations when packages are stable
